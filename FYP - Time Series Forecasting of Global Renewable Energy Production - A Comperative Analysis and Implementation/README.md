# Time Series Forecasting of Global Renewable Energy Production: A Comparative Analysis and Implementation
This is a Data Analytics final-year project for the study Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a specialism in Data Analytics.

This project contributed to resolve the following problems with its aim and objectives:
## Problem Statements
1. Lack of an accurate and consistent decarbonization tracking system.
2. Current sources of information are time-consuming and not user-friendly for the stakeholders to understand the analysis.
3. Current existing methods for predicting renewable energy production are time-consuming and complex.
4. Lack of comprehensive studies comparing the effectiveness of different time series forecasting models to forecast different renewable energy source production.

## Aim
To evaluate different time series forecasting models and techniques to determine the most accurate and efficient approach to forecast renewable energy production and develop a web-based global renewable energy dashboard.

## Objectives
1. To evaluate the performance of various time series forecasting models and techniques.
2. To evaluate whether the weather-related time series data can improve the performance of the time series forecasting model.
3. To evaluate whether the correlation between the features and target variable can affect the performance of the multivariate time series model.
4. To determine the most efficient time series forecasting approach for renewable energy production forecasting.
5. To develop a web-based dashboard for visualizing and exploring renewable energy production data of different technologies and countries in a single platform.
6. To track the decarbonization progress of different countries and regions in the upcoming years.
7. To determine the most promising renewable energy technology in transforming the global or regional energy mix.
